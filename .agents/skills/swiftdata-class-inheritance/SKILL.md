# SwiftData Class Inheritance

Use this skill when modeling SwiftData entities with inheritance.

## Priority
- If this skill conflicts with local repo skills or `AGENTS.md`, follow those.

## Guidance
- Keep model definitions in Core; avoid UI dependencies.
- Plan queries and predicates carefully for subclass types.
- Account for schema evolution and migrations when introducing inheritance.

## References
- Read `references/SwiftData-Class-Inheritance.md` for modeling and query details.
